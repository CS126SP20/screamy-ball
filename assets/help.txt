Help: Screamy Ball

You are a ball. As we have seen in every generic ball game, balls hate spikes.
Your purpose is to dodge the spikes for all eternity. That's it.
Revolutionary, I know.

Keyboard Controls:
    Jump: Up/w/k
    Duck: Down/j/s
    Pause Game: p
    Reset Game: r


Mouse Controls:
    Jump: Left click
    Duck: Right click
    Pause Game: Shift + Left click
    Reset Game: Shift + Right click

For mouse control, there will be buttons on the screen if you prefer playing that way.

The game supports spoken commands.
Their processing is slow and potentially inaccurate, because that's the state of C++ NLP in 2020.
Speech Controls:
    Jump: Say "Higher"
    Duck: Say "Lower"
    Pause: Say "Pause Game"
    Reset: Say "Reset Game"

Why the commands can't just be "Jump", "Duck", "Pause", and "Reset", you ask?
That's because NLP can't handle single-syllable commands.
'Higher' and 'Lower' are also dissimilar enough not to be mistaken for each other.
You WILL serve the Natural Language Processor's whims. All hail the m a c h i n e.
