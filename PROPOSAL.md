# Screamy Ball

Author: Ishita Rao

---

Screamy Ball is a recreation of Google Chrome’s [T. Rex Game](https://chromedino.com/), except the obstacles are spikes and the T. Rex is a ball that can be controlled in 3 ways:
1. The mouse
1. The keyboard
1. Spoken commands

### Background knowledge I have on the project
I know how to work with the Cinder library to create graphics for the game, and I know how to use Cinder to add keyboard and mouse control to the game. 

### Why I want to do the project
I have lots of memories of playing the T. Rex Game for hours when the internet connection at my house got cut out, so I thought it would be fun to recreate the game. Also, I’m very interested in Natural Language Processing in general, and I wanted to incorporate speech recognition into my game to get some hands-on practice with an NLP library.

### External Library
For this project, I will be using a Cinder Block: [ciSpeech](https://github.com/Hebali/ciSpeech). It provides Cinder support for [CMU PocketSphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/), a speech recognizer written in C++. 

### A Rough Timeline  
1. Week 1: 
	1. Graphics for the game
	1. Make the game playable via the keyboard
	1. Start working on the game engine
1. Week 2: 
	1. Finish the game engine
	1. Make the game playable via a set of spoken commands (‘Jump’, ‘Pause’, ‘Reset’, ‘Help’)
1. Week 3:
	1. Make the game playable via the mouse
	1. Add a main menu
	1. Add music

### Stretch goals
1. Add a leaderboard using SQLite
1. Add collectible items to increase points
1. Add power-ups
1. Attach an RPG-style story to the game
